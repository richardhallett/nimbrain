#nimblebrain

This is an implementation of a brainfuck language interpreter written in Nim

This was a learning exercise for experieming with the Nim language more than it was learning to write a brainfuck interpreter.
Therefore it is largely similiar to my previous brainfuck interpreter I wrote in F#

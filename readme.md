# nimbrain

This is an implementation of a brainfuck language interpreter and comppiler written in Nim.

This was a learning exercise for experieming with the Nim language more than it was learning to write a brainfuck interpreter and also experiment with Nim macros to compile brainfuck programs.
Brainfuck is despite the explicit name a useful simple toy language.

As I've done this before in F#, some similarities exist to F# version
